# Beginner Portfolio

## Description

This is my first foray into designing something from scratch with no starter code. The project itself is a portfolio designed to showcase my work in a clear and concise manner that helps potential employers be able to quickly view and interact with said work. It was created via html and css. 

- What was your motivation?
My motivation was in being able to showcase my work in a clear and concise manner that makes it easier for people unaffiliated with me to get to know my skills quickly. 
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not \"Because it was a homework assignment.")
I built this both as a primer for building something from scratch as well as for being something that I can come back to as I collect more works to display.
- What problem does it solve?
It makes it easy to showcase all my works in one uniform space.
- What did you learn?
I learned how to make use of html and css in order to organize items like my work in a page, and in a manner that entices employers. 

## Installation

The steps to install my project are quite simple. You can either open it up directly via link, or install the repo and do a right click on index to open up the html in a web browser. Either way should take you to the site, in which you can interact with the works by clicking them to view. 

## Usage

Open the site, browse the content, and click what you want to see more of. This should then take you to that project's corresponding link, in which you can then view it in its entirety.
